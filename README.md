## NEVACS

The project aims to perform neuromorphic-enabled video-activated cell sorting. The event stream from the event camera is received and preprocessed, and the preprocessed event image is then inferred by the spiking neural network (SNN) classification model, which is deployed on the neuromorphic chip.  The classification results of the SNN classification are then used for sort control.
